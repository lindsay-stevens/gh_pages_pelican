Title: About
Date: 2018-07-15

I am a clinical trials data management specialist with over 10 years of experience. In this time I have:

- Implemented sophisticated data processing and reporting tools, projects, and systems.
- Developed a variety of data collection and validation systems for clinical research.
- Worked with and coordinated numerous multi-centre oncology clinical research studies.

I am interested in helping researchers efficiently collect accurate and complete data, and to support their decision-making processes through data systems, analysis, analytics, and visualisations. I am uniquely positioned to do so, with extensive clinical research domain knowledge as well as strong technical skills.

I am motivated by the participants and clinical staff that collaborate to advance medical science through research.

Looking forward, I am studying a Master of Biostatistics to further broaden the range of solutions and advice I can offer.
