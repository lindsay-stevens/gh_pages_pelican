Title: About
Date: 2020-06-27

I am a clinical trials data management specialist with over 12 years of experience. In this time I have implemented many high-value data management and reporting systems, using a wide range of technologies, working with diverse stakeholders.

In addition to technical expertise I have extensive domain knowledge of clinical research from working in coordination teams, developing components of research-specific software, and have completed a Master of Biostatistics.

I am interested in helping researchers efficiently collect accurate and complete data, and supporting both practicing clinicians and their patients in their decision-making processes through data systems, analysis, analytics, and visualisations.

I am motivated by the participants and clinical staff that collaborate to advance medical science through research.
