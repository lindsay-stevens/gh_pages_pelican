Title: About
Date: 2018-07-15

I am a clinical trials data management specialist with over 10 years of experience. In this time I have:

- Worked with and coordinated numerous multi-centre oncology clinical research studies,
- Developed a variety of data collection and validation systems for clinical research,
- Implemented sophisticated data processing and reporting tools, projects, and systems.

Looking forward, I am studying a Master of Biostatistics to further broaden the range of solutions and advice I can offer.

I am motivated by the dedicated medical professionals and participants that collaborate to advance medical science through research.

I am interested in helping researchers efficiently collect accurate and complete data, and to support their decision-making processes.
